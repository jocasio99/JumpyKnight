# JumpyKnight
First platformer game

My first game. This short game is about a knight who needs to frontflip their way to collect all 10 coins. Hopping on platforms and avoiding the slimes. You need to reach the end without dying. If you can collect all 10 coins you get a secret message at the end of the game. It seems to run better as is (Not in Fullscreen). It does not have a working ending yet.

Controls:
- Jump: Space
- Moving Left and Right: A (left) and D (right) or left arrow and right arrow

Updates:
- v0.8 Main Menu is completed, just need to make the ending and try to make the death look a bit better
- v0.7 1/28/2025: Movement, animations, killzones, enemies, coins, most of the map and coin counter are completed. It is playable (better not in fullscreen) but I need to fix how the game's ending works, how the death animation looks, and SECRET.
